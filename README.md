QR codes detection in images

Project for the class [Introducci√≥n a los Sistemas Inteligentes](https://fagonzalezo.github.io/iis-2020-1/) at Universidad Nacional de Colombia. Project done by [@crdgonzalezca](https://github.com/crdgonzalezca) and [@NicolasRestrepoTorres](https://github.com/NicolasRestrepoTorres).

You can find a Notebook and a python script `utils.py` with the used code for the development of the project, additionally, there is a `Report.pdf` where you can find more information about this process.

For the QR detection we have used the *tiny version of YOLOv3*, the [Darknet](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet) by AlexeyAB.
